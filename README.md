### **Affidavit of Jake Mackenzie Regarding Lost Paperwork – MoneyClaim UK**

"Jurisdiction: The Laws of England and Wales (Maritime, Small Claims and Commercial Law)."

I, **Jake Mackenzie**, residing at 43 Glebeland Gardens, do hereby swear, under penalty of perjury, the following facts to be true and accurate to the best of my knowledge:

1. I initiated a case against **Guardian Media Group** in **June 2024**. L7QZ9D42. The process was initially clear and efficient, and I was pleased with the well-managed system in the UK.
2. However, soon after my case commenced, I stopped receiving updates, creating unnecessary uncertainty.
3. The name **Stephen Goedhart** was mentioned in relation to my case—an individual who appears to enjoy significant protection.
4. When I attempted to get a response, I found that I could only get a response if I escalated the matter to **OPTIC**. The lack of communication and obstruction was, at best, negligent.

6. In **Novemeber 2024**, my paperwork was inexplicably "lost," requiring me to resend all documents. I do not think this is the fault of Mr Lino Lawrence, but unknown persons in Moneyclaim.

7. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ebbd37c-471a-4495-86ee-b334ee0e5fb1)

8. My case was then **struck out on December 3rd 2024**, but MoneyClaim UK failed to notify me of this decision, depriving me of the opportunity to respond. Not informing someone of a strike out order is *negligent*.
9. After further escalation to OPTIC (who were fairly helfpful), I was tersely informed, by M Johns of Surrey Civil Courts, **one month after the strike-out order**—that my case had been struck out.

10. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1cb44c7-7418-401c-9ae8-7badba50892a)


How can I contest a strike out order if I am not informed of it, either by email or His Majesty's postal service?

10. The repeated lack of transparency and mismanagement of my case suggests gross negligence, at best. I have wasted hours of time on a process short on competence and good faith.
12. I initially only sought mediation, yet this request was denied. I strongly believe that my rights were not upheld throughout this process.
13. As a matter of principle and fairness, I will **escalate this case as high as I can**, until I am offered compensation from the courts themselves. 
14. I am asking all 2025/45/ABX mediator groups to investigate Moneyclaim UK, as I believe there are corrupt elements within their system. I am also opening this public Github Repo, for all eyes to see.

I swear that the above statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

**Signed Under Penalty of Perjury:**  

  Jake Mackenzie, Friday 13th, 2025.

### **Cover Letter to MoneyClaim UK**

**Jake Mackenzie**  

**To:** MoneyClaim UK, Surrey Civil Courts, OPTIC and friends.

**Subject:** Urgent Complaint – Lost Paperwork, Unjust Strikeout & Escalation  

Dear Moneyclaim and friends,  

I am writing to formally address the mishandling of my case L7QZ9D42, which began in **June 2024** against **Guardian Media Group**. Despite initially smooth proceedings, I encountered severe obstacles due to a lack of communication, unexplained delays, and the ultimate loss of my paperwork in **December 2024**.  

After resubmitting the required documents, my case was **struck out later that month**, yet MoneyClaim UK failed to notify me, depriving me of the opportunity to respond. It was only after further escalation that I was tersely informed **one month later** that my claim had been dismissed—an unacceptable delay that points to negligence. It is standard UK legal practice to notify all parties when a case is struck out, including in the small claims track. I was not informed of the strike-out order until a month later—only after escalating to OPTIC—which deprived me of timely options to respond or appeal. This constitutes a serious procedural oversight and may amount to administrative negligence. I am requesting a review of the case file and communication records to clarify how this failure occurred.

My **request for mediation was denied**, despite my reasonable expectation that my rights would be upheld. Given these failures, I am demanding a thorough review of my case, along with a clear explanation of why these procedural errors occurred.  

The following actions are respectfully ordered, in the name of The King of England:  

- A formal acknowledgment of these procedural failures.  
- 10,000 British Pounds compensation, to reflect hours of wasted time.

Please provide a substantive response within **7 days**. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will escalate further.  

I expect fairness and professionalism from MoneyClaim UK, OPTIC, and Surry Civil. I urge you to correct this unjust situation without further delay.  

Sincerely,  

Jake Mackenzie
