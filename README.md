# MoneyclaimUKAbuseofProcess
A case against corruption in the UK courts. Mysteriously lost files, strikeouts with no notification, and other bad faith behaviour

Got it, Jake. I've incorporated your details into the affidavit and cover letter while keeping them assertive and structured. Here’s the updated version:

### **Affidavit of Jake Mackenzie Regarding Lost Paperwork – MoneyClaim UK**

I, **Jake Mackenzie**, residing at [Your Address], do hereby declare the following facts to be true and accurate to the best of my knowledge:

1. I initiated a case against **Guardian Media Group** in **June 2024**. The process was initially clear and efficient, and I was pleased with the well-managed system in the UK.
2. However, soon after my case commenced, I stopped receiving updates, creating unnecessary uncertainty.
3. The name **Stephen Goedhart** was mentioned in relation to my case—an individual who appears to enjoy significant protection.
4. When I attempted to get a response, I found that I could only escalate the matter to **OPTIC**. The lack of communication and obstruction was frustrating and, at best, negligent.
5. In **December 2024**, my paperwork was inexplicably "lost," requiring me to resend all documents.
6. My case was then **struck out in December 2024**, but MoneyClaim UK failed to notify me of this decision, depriving me of the opportunity to respond.
7. After further escalation, I was finally informed—**two months after the strike-out order**—that my case had been dismissed, but this was communicated in an unnecessarily terse manner.
8. The repeated lack of transparency and mismanagement of my case suggests gross negligence, at best.
9. I initially only sought mediation, yet this request was denied. I strongly believe that my rights were not upheld throughout this process.
10. As a matter of principle and fairness, I will **escalate this case as high as I can**, until I am afforded a fair hearing by honest men and women.

I affirm that the above statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

**Signed:**

### **Cover Letter to MoneyClaim UK**

**To:** MoneyClaim UK  
[Address]  

**Subject:** Urgent Complaint – Lost Paperwork, Unjust Strikeout & Escalation  

Dear [Recipient's Name],  

I am writing to formally address the mishandling of my case **[Claim Reference Number]**, which began in **June 2024** against **Guardian Media Group**. Despite initially smooth proceedings, I encountered severe obstacles due to a lack of communication, unexplained delays, and the ultimate loss of my paperwork in **December 2024**.  

After resubmitting the required documents, my case was **struck out later that month**, yet MoneyClaim UK failed to notify me, depriving me of the opportunity to respond. It was only after further escalation that I was tersely informed **two months later** that my claim had been dismissed—an unacceptable delay that points to negligence.  

My **request for mediation was denied**, despite my reasonable expectation that my rights would be upheld. Given these failures, I am demanding a thorough review of my case, along with a clear explanation of why these procedural errors occurred.  

I request urgent action on the following:  
- A formal acknowledgment of these procedural failures.  
- Clear guidance on how my case can be fairly reconsidered.  
- Confirmation that corrective measures will be taken to ensure future claimants do not experience similar issues.  

Please provide a substantive response within **7 days**. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will escalate further.  

I expect fairness and professionalism from MoneyClaim UK. I urge you to correct this unjust situation without further delay.  

Sincerely,  
Jake Mackenzie
