### **Affidavit of Jake Mackenzie Regarding Lost Paperwork – MoneyClaim UK**

I, **Jake Mackenzie**, residing at 43 Glebeland Gardens, do hereby swear, under penalty of perjury, the following facts to be true and accurate to the best of my knowledge:

1. I initiated a case against **Guardian Media Group** in **June 2024**. [[[CASE NUMBER]]] The process was initially clear and efficient, and I was pleased with the well-managed system in the UK.
2. However, soon after my case commenced, I stopped receiving updates, creating unnecessary uncertainty.
3. The name **Stephen Goedhart** was mentioned in relation to my case—an individual who appears to enjoy significant protection.
4. When I attempted to get a response, I found that I could only get a response if I escalated the matter to **OPTIC**. The lack of communication and obstruction was, at best, negligent.
5. In **December 2024**, my paperwork was inexplicably "lost," requiring me to resend all documents. [[[PIC]]]
6. My case was then **struck out in December 2024**, but MoneyClaim UK failed to notify me of this decision, depriving me of the opportunity to respond. [[[PIC]]]
7. After further escalation, I was finally informed—**two months after the strike-out order**—that my case had been dismissed, but this was communicated in an unnecessarily terse manner. [[[PIC]]]1
8. The repeated lack of transparency and mismanagement of my case suggests gross negligence, at best.
9. I initially only sought mediation, yet this request was denied. I strongly believe that my rights were not upheld throughout this process.
10. As a matter of principle and fairness, I will **escalate this case as high as I can**, until I am afforded a fair hearing by honest men and women.
11. I am asking all 2025/45 mediator groups to investigate Moneyclaim UK, as I believe there are corrupt elements within their system. I am also opening this public Github Repo, for all eyes to see.

I swear that the above statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

### **Cover Letter to MoneyClaim UK**

**Jake Mackenzie**  
[Your Address]  
[Your Email]  
[Date]  

**To:** MoneyClaim UK  
[Address]  

**Subject:** Urgent Complaint – Lost Paperwork, Unjust Strikeout & Escalation  

Dear [Recipient's Name],  

I am writing to formally address the mishandling of my case **[Claim Reference Number]**, which began in **June 2024** against **Guardian Media Group**. Despite initially smooth proceedings, I encountered severe obstacles due to a lack of communication, unexplained delays, and the ultimate loss of my paperwork in **December 2024**.  

After resubmitting the required documents, my case was **struck out later that month**, yet MoneyClaim UK failed to notify me, depriving me of the opportunity to respond. It was only after further escalation that I was tersely informed **two months later** that my claim had been dismissed—an unacceptable delay that points to negligence.  

My **request for mediation was denied**, despite my reasonable expectation that my rights would be upheld. Given these failures, I am demanding a thorough review of my case, along with a clear explanation of why these procedural errors occurred.  

I request urgent action on the following:  
- A formal acknowledgment of these procedural failures.  
- Clear guidance on how my case can be fairly reconsidered.  
- Confirmation that corrective measures will be taken to ensure future claimants do not experience similar issues.  

Please provide a substantive response within **7 days**. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will escalate further.  

I expect fairness and professionalism from MoneyClaim UK. I urge you to correct this unjust situation without further delay.  

Sincerely,  
Jake Mackenzie
